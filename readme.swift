// Project Tic Tac Toe GOAT - Requirements set by CMG: (Requirements Paste Verbatim)

//Story
//
//As a CMG employee, I want to see how you code a game of Tic Tac Toe, so that I can get a feel for a candidate's skills and strengths.
//
//Acceptance criteria
//
//1)Application is a stand alone native mobile (java, swift, objective-c) game of tic tac toe
//2)Computer (AI) will never lose a game
//3)Application should be able to run without modifications on IOS or Android
//4)Game will let player choose to be either X or O, computer will take other choice
//5)Game will let player go first
//
//Submission Tips
//
//Quality counts! A good submission that takes a while is better than a poor submission quickly.
//Make sure your submission accurately reflects your development style.
//Commit early and often, with good messages.
//Comments and Unit tests are appreciated but not required, if you know good practice, then show us.
//Research the AI, there are multiple well known algorithms available, show us your implementation.
//Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
//Submissions
//
//Fork this repo and send us a pull request.
//If you prefer you can send us a ZIP of your submission, due to email filters, rename the file to *.txt and mention it is a ZIP in your email.

//_______________________Problems/Ambiguity/Assumptions/Methods of solving____________________________________
//Problems & Ambiguity:
//1. Application is native: clear: Swift
//2. AI:
//      --clear: AI for this simple game means it will be able to start a move and decide a move once the player makes one.
//      --unclear: In submission, It says that there are multiple algorithms available; not quite sure if this involves algorithms for making next moves, mapping decisions, making optimal moves, or self learning.
//3. Modifications on iOS: None
//4. Players will be able to make a choice on choosing X or O 
//5. Game will let player go first:
//      --clear: Game is able to make a decision at any point in the game
//      --unclear: Will the player go first everytime?

//Assumptions:
//1, 3, 4 are clear without Assumptions
//2. --AI will not be self learning.
//   --AI will use my self made algorithm
//   --AI will not use any well known algorithm for sake of Plagiarism risks or over complication of the simple problem that is needed to be solve.
//   --AI will make optimal decision by deriving from the algorithm that is base off of my analysis of tic-tac-toe game never-losing strategy
//5. Game will always let the player go first instead of having AI make any initial moves. 

//Proposal:
// I will create Tic Tac Toe game natively mobile application in Swift that uses self made algorithm that does not uses any self-learning technique which always let the users go first and choose X or O for user alias with no modifications in iOS.
